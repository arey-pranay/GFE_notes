A Function object's length property indicates how many arguments the function expects, i.e., the number of formal parameters:

Only parameters before the first one with a default value are counted.
A destructuring pattern counts as a single parameter.
The rest parameter is excluded.

--- 

 the number of arguments the function is called with (which is determined by arguments.length)

 --- 

 if you use for..in loop in an array, you will get the indices, so use it only for objects. use the for..of loop in arrays. parseInt('4') and Number('4') is used to get integer values.
